1. Ensure Dependencies are Installed Correctly
Make sure you have installed the requests module in the correct directory and included it in your zip file.

Create a directory for your Lambda function and its dependencies:
mkdir my_lambda_function
cd my_lambda_function

Install the requests module into this directory:
pip install requests -t .

Add your Lambda function code to this directory. For example, create a file named lambda_function.py with your function code.
Zip the contents of the directory:
zip -r9 lambda_function.zip .

2. Upload the Zip File to S3
Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
Create a new bucket or use an existing one.
Upload the lambda_function.zip file to the bucket.
3. Update Your Lambda Function to Use the S3 Bucket
Go to the Lambda service in the AWS Management Console.
Create a new function or select an existing one.
Set the function code to use the S3 bucket:
In the “Code” section, choose “Upload a file from Amazon S3.”
Enter the S3 bucket name and the object key (the path to your zip file).
4. Verify the Directory Structure
Ensure your zip file has the correct structure. It should look something like this:

lambda_function.zip
├── lambda_function.py
└── requests/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── adapters.py
    ├── api.py
    ├── auth.py
    ├── ...

5. Check Lambda Function Configuration
Ensure your Lambda function has the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket. You can do this by attaching an appropriate IAM role to your Lambda function.

6. Test Your Lambda Function
Deploy your Lambda function and test it to ensure it can import the requests module and execute correctly.
